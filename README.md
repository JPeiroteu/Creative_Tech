## Deployment

To deploy the project to a live server or hosting service, you can follow these general steps:

1. Ensure that your code is committed and pushed to your repository (in this case, GitHub).
2. Choose a hosting service (in this case, Cyclic) and create a new account if necessary.
3. Create a new project on your hosting service and connect it to your GitHub repository.
4. Set up the configuration for your hosting service. For example, you may need to specify the domain name and configure any necessary environment variables.
5. Build and deploy your project. This process will vary depending on your specific setup and technology stack.

For this project, since you've already chosen GitHub as your repository and Cyclic as your hosting service, you can follow the specific steps below:

1. Push your code to your GitHub repository.
2. Create a new project on Cyclic and connect it to your GitHub repository. You can find detailed instructions on how to do this on Cyclic's website.
3. Set up the necessary environment variables in Cyclic. For example, you will need to set the database credentials and any other necessary configuration options.
4. Build and deploy your project using Cyclic's built-in deployment tools. Again, you can find detailed instructions on how to do this on their website.

With these steps, your project should be deployed and accessible online.
